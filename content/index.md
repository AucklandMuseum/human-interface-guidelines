title: Auckland Museum - Human Interface Digital Guidelines
type: index
---

The aim of the Auckland Museum HIGs is to promote a coherent look and feel and visitor experience across multiple galleries and over time.

The HIG are based on Auckland Museums Digital Experience Design principles and are  informed in part by [Google’s Material Design](https://material.io/), and [Te Papa’s Digital Language System](https://te-papa.github.io/).

The Human Interface Guidelines are intended to assist developers and designers when creating engaging and intuitive digital Interactive experiences.

Throughout the guidelines, we specify what you should **‘refer to’** – meaning use as guidelines or reference; and what you should **‘adhere to’** - compulsory elements.

If something doesn’t make sense or is unrealistic for your particular digital product, please contact your project manager with the problem and a suggested alternative.
