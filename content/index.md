title: Auckland Museum - Human Interface Digital Guidelines
type: index
---

## Overview

The aim of the Auckland Museum HIGs is to promote a coherent look and feel and visitor experience across multiple galleries and over time.

These guidelines are in the early stages of development. They draw on various Auckland Museum resources, [Google’s Material Design](https://material.io/), and [Te Papa’s Digital Language System](https://te-papa.github.io/).

Throughout the guidelines, we specify what you should **‘refer to’** – meaning use as guidelines or reference; and what you should **‘adhere to’** - compulsory elements.
