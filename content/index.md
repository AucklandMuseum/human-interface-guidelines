title: Auckland Museum - Human Interface Digital Guidelines
type: index
---

The aim of the Auckland Museum Human Interface Guidelines (HIGs) is to promote **a coherent visitor experience throughout galleries and exhibitions** - maintaining the look and feel over time and across interfaces.

The HIGs are **for developers and designers** who are creating digital experiences for Auckland Museum. 

The HIGs are based on our Digital Experience Design Principles, augmented by [Google's Material Design](https://material.io/), and [Te Papa's Digital Language System](https://te-papa.github.io/).

{{< alert title="What is a guideline, and what is compulsory?" >}}

Throughout the guidelines, we specify what you should **'refer to'** â€“ meaning use as guidelines or reference; and what you should **'adhere to'** - compulsory elements.

If something doesn't make sense or is unrealistic for your particular digital product, please contact your project manager with the problem and a suggested alternative.
