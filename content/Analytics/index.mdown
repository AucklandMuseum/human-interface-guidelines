We use Google Tag Manager (GTM) to assess the effectiveness of digital products once they are on the floor. We will send through a GTM snippet to be placed within the header of the HTML and/or Javascript. You are required to implement this code in your digital product, and if required, appropriate use of events to track visitor activity.

In terms of **what to measure**, select what is most appropriate for the digital product you are producing. [Te Papa's analytics guidelines](https://te-papa.github.io/_pages/foundations/analytics/) provide a good guide as to what to consider.
