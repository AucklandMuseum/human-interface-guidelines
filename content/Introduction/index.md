The aim of the Auckland Museum HIGs is to promote a coherent look and feel and visitor experience across multiple galleries and over time.

These guidelines are in the early stages of development. They draw on various Auckland Museum resources, [Google’s Material Design](https://material.io/), and [Te Papa’s Digital Language System](https://te-papa.github.io/).

Throughout the guidelines, we specify what you should ‘refer to’ – meaning use as guidelines or reference; and what you should ‘adhere to’ - compulsory elements.

If something doesn’t make sense or is unrealistic for your particular digital product, please contact your project manager with the problem and a suggested alternative.

## Designing for the museum context

### Our Visitors

The visitor journey often starts outside of the physical Museum via the Auckland Museum website or social media channels outside, which lead to a museum visit, and multiple passive and active digital interactions during the stay. Visitors may collect or generate personalised content to take away or build-upon after their visit, and these interacts with our online channels may lead on to their next visit.

The wide audience range of Auckland Museum creates interesting challenges for interactive designers. Digital briefs usually specify audiences, but designers should strive for inclusive experiences, and engagement across the visitor spectrum.

### Our spaces
[Create a simple diagram identifying common current state interactive executions in space - Could include projections, touch tables, wall screens, screens in walls, partitions, angled ‘kiosk’ screens, AR devices, VR stations.]


### Environmental factors
The design of audio for interactives should into account background noise levels, which may vary widely, and overflow into adjacent spaces. Relying on audio for user feedback may not be sufficient in some circumstances.

Each gallery space will present different lighting characteristics to design which will be identified at during the initial design stages.

### System performance
Building interactives for fast response times and minimising calls to data sources will
