      <description>Overview The aim of the Auckland Museum HIGs is to promote a coherent look and feel and visitor experience across multiple galleries and over time.
These guidelines are in the early stages of development. They draw on various Auckland Museum resources, Google’s Material Design, and Te Papa’s Digital Language System.
Throughout the guidelines, we specify what you should ‘refer to’ – meaning use as guidelines or reference; and what you should ‘adhere to’ - compulsory elements.</description>

They have been peer reviewed by the Museum’s Digital Advisory Group.
Extending the Gallery Renewal Principles and Visitor Market research insights, the Digital Experience Design Principles are high-level statements around ‘digital experiences’ at Auckland Museum.</description>

Visitors may collect or generate personalised content to take away or build-upon after their visit, and these interacts with our online channels may lead on to their next visit.</description>
